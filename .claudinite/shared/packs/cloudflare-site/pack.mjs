// Technology-plus-aspect pack: a static tree served from Cloudflare Workers static
// assets on its own domain — the nightly release that uploads it, the boundary of what
// reaches a public URL, and the parts of the deployment only a person holding the
// Cloudflare account can do.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE: the version. public-website owns the scheme and the page stamp,
// and the release reaches that pack's `public/version.mjs` to advance it — when the
// pack is declared. A repo that declares only this one is uploaded unversioned. And
// nothing here knows any other host: a site is served from Cloudflare or from
// something else, never both, so no other hosting pack is named.
//
// Fingerprint: a near-root JSON wrangler config that declares `assets.directory`.
// The sibling cloudflare-workers pack fingerprints on a wrangler config of any
// shape (it is about the runtime and its bindings); a config declaring a published
// directory is a site, which is what this pack is about — so a Worker backend with
// no assets carries none of this.
