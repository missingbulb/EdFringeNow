// bump, upload the tree. Nothing here is a judgment call, which is why the task runs
// no agent — and nothing here is a marketplace action either: `wrangler deploy` is a
// CLI, so the release needs no workflow of its own and lives entirely in the queue.
//
// ORDER IS DELIBERATE: the bump lands on the branch BEFORE the upload. Either half
// can fail, and of the two possible drifts only one is silent — a site serving a
// version the repo has no record of. A consumed version number that never shipped is
// visible in the park and costs nothing; the next release simply takes the next one.
//
// THE VERSION IS ANOTHER PACK'S. public-website owns the scheme and the page stamp,
// and publishes them through its `public/version.mjs`; this worker imports that seam
// when the pack is on the mount and releases without a bump when it is not. Nothing
// else of that pack is reached, and nothing here knows how the version is shaped.
