Records for `packs/static-website/pack.mjs`'s `version` field, one row per bump — added going forward from
the version this file was introduced beside (60821.1); earlier bumps are not backfilled.

| Version | Date | What changed |
|---|---|---|
| 60903.1 | 2026-09-03 | A skill's `SKILL.md` opens on what to do, not on what the skill is: the self-describing framing and the pointers to prose the reader already holds are gone. |
| 60902.1 | 2026-09-02 | `RULES.md` drops the descriptive framing the pack README already carries — the file carries rules only. |
| 60823.1 | 2026-08-23 | Its release skill names the member settings file by its current name (#1252). |
| 60822.1 | 2026-08-22 | The manifest stops restating its own tree (#1246): `id`, `prose`, `badge`, `skills`, `worldRules` and `workRules` are resolved from the pack directory and an absent `detect`/`marker` means no fingerprint. Coded rules move into `worldRules/`/`workRules/` and tests into `test/`, which no vendor set ships. `minEngineVersion` rises to the engine release that reads all of it. |
| 60903.2 | 2026-09-03 | `static-site-releases` forces itself for `.github/site.config` and the vendored `static-site-*` workflows (`force-load-on-file-edits-paths`) (#1648): the guard holds an edit there until the skill is loaded. |
| 60903.3 | 2026-09-03 | The managed-stub-copies rule moves out of `RULES.md` into `static-site-releases`, forced for the `static-site-*` workflows (#1662). |
