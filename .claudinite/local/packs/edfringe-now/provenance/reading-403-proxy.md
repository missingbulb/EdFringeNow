## 2026-08-07 · born · Note the *.edfringenow.com egress allowance in the pack rules (#262)
- **Source:** #260.

  policy denial, not a site outage, which the proxy's status endpoint confirms.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude
- **Mechanism:** a caveat under the same RULES.md section.
- **Landed:** #262, Closes #260

- **Reason:** the Fringe API host had begun answering 403 after a negotiated tunnel, a different
  fact from the CONNECT denial the rule described.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude Opus 5
- **Landed:** #609, Closes #608
