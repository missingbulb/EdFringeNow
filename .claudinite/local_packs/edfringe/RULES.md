# EdFringeNow — project working rules

Lessons captured while working in this repo, layered on the shared Claudinite
canon. Terse and concrete; read the matching one before working in that area.

## Verifying UI changes visually (the `index.html` page and everything under `plan/`)

Visual verification of the pages **is** available in this sandbox. Don't skip it
or downgrade to "verified by logic review only" claiming no browser exists — a
browser is here, and a UI change isn't done until it has been looked at.

- Serve the repo and drive it with the preinstalled Chromium (or Playwright):
  `python3 -m http.server 8000`, then screenshot / click through
  `http://localhost:8000`. The app fetches `data/shows.json`, so it must be
  served over HTTP rather than opened as a file — and `localhost` bypasses the
  agent proxy, so the browser reaches the page even though external hosts need
  the proxy.
- To build a `/plan` favourites list for the render, a plain slug-per-line text
  file is accepted by the parser — pick shows spanning the statuses (and some
  same-day doubles) you want to eyeball.
- To match edfringe.com's live styling (e.g. the ticket-availability colours on
  the `/plan` grid), fetch the official site's CSS with `curl` through the agent
  proxy and read the palette out of it. `WebFetch` returns rendered text without
  the CSS, and headless Chromium cannot tunnel the proxy to reach an external
  host — `curl` is the one path that works for off-box assets.
